Iterator for metadata crawling.

Example:
    >>> import crawler
    >>> Crawler=crawler.Crawler('Some directory to crawl')
    >>> #Loop thru dataset objects returned by Crawler
    >>> for dataset in Crawler:
    >>>     metadata=dataset.metadata

@todo:
    - Make this faster!!! It's verrry slow on large filesystems...
    - Explore removing regular expression and searching using fnmatch instead
    - Can this be rewritten to yield files as they're found instead of building a complete list of files first? Probably.
      However, the multiple loops are there to ensure certain types of files are dealt with first, but perhaps that logic
      needs to be handled by the formats library
